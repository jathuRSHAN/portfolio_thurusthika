      "description": "This study proposes a non-invasive method to estimate core body temperature (CBT) using machine learning models integratedwithwearable sensors. The model uses skin temperature, heart rate, and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity), combinedwithuser-specific metadata such as age, gender, and health conditions. A Random Forest model was trained on volunteer data toproviderealtime core temperature predictions with a reliable accuracy (RMSE of 0.307, MAE of 0.237). The systemis designedfor wearabledevices, allowing continuous health monitoring and providing early detection of potential heat-related illnesses.",
